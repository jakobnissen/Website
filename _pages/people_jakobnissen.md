## Research

Jakob Nybo Nissen works in the Human Proteome Variation group as an external PhD student based in Technical University of Denmark. He is doing research in method development in [metagenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics), and is in particular interested in [metagenomic binning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binning_(metagenomics)), molecular evolution and phylogeny, and [metagenomic assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly).

Previous work in the group include work the gut microbiome of Australian marsupial mammals and [copy-number variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-number_variation) in the [Danish population](http://www.genomedenmark.dk/).

Currently, he is working on using [deep learning for metagenomic binning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/490078v2), and probabilistic taxonomic annotation of metagenomic bins.


## Background

2011-2014: [Bachelor of science in biology](https://studier.ku.dk/bachelor/biologi/undervisning-og-opbygning/specialiseringer/generel-profil/), with speciality in molecular- and cell biology from University of Copenhagen.
2014-2016: Master's in [Omics from Sino-Danish Center](http://sdc.university/education/masters-programme/lei/).

Jakob Nybo Nissen was employed in 2016 in the metagenomics group at DTU Bioinformatics. In 2018, he became the PhD student of Simon Rasmussen, and became affiliated with University of Copenhagen in late 2018.
