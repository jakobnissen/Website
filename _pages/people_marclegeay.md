## Short presentation

I joined Lars Juhl Jensen's group as a postdoc in September 2018. The group works with biological networks. I work on label propagation in networks so that we can associate a function to non-annoted proteins. I also develop a Cytoscape App in order to deals with site-specific data, time-series data, etc.
