## Research experience

<img style="float: right; margin: 5px;" src="https://jensenlab.org/_pages/people_marielocardpaulet.jpg" /> 

- **January 2019 -- present**:\
Postdoctoral fellow at the [Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research](http://www.cpr.ku.dk/), University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
- **June 2015 -- December 2018**: \
Postdoctoral fellow in the [Laboratory of proteomics and mass spectrometry of biomolecules](http://www.ipbs.fr/proteomics-and-mass-spectrometry-biomolecules) directed by Odile Burlet-Schiltz (CNRS IPBS, Toulouse, France).<!--- \
Main project: *Global phosphoproteomic analysis of TCR signalling to identify key phospho-regulations underlying TCR signalling in primary T cells*\
Main achievements:
    + Generation of time-resolved high throughput phosphoproteomic data sets.
    + Development of a bioinformatics pipeline to quantitatively analyse post-translational modifications (PTM) by mass spectrometry.
    + Integration of in-house generated data with publicly available data (expression, protein-protein interaction, PTMs). 
  +Development of informatics tools to visualise/analyse mass spectrometry data (top-down and bottom-up). -->
- **June 2010 -- June 2015**: \
Postdoctoral fellow in the Cell communication team and Systems Oncology team directed by Claus Jorgensen (ICR/CRUK-MI), United Kingdom. <!--- \
Main project: *Phosphoproteomic analysis of interacting tumour and endothelial cells to identify regulatory mechanisms of transendothelial migration*\
Main achievements:
    + Generation of a data set of phosphorylation sites regulated upon interaction between cancer cells and endothelial cells in co-culture using cell-specific labelling (SILAC). 
    + Identification of phospho-proteins involved in cancer cells exit from the blood vessel and validation using in vitro strategies. 
    + Validation of the involvement of EPHA2 Tyr772 phosphorylation in extravasation through in vitro and in vivo experiments. -->
- **October 2006 -- December 2009**: \
PhD of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Laboratory biochemistry of disrupted systems directed by Jean Armengaud (CEA DSV SBTN), Bagnols sur Ceze, France.<!--- \
Thesis title: *Study of the three human GPN-loop GTPases: a pivotal role for hGPN1* \
Main achievements:
    + Cloning, expression and purification of the three GPN-loop GTPases.
    + Biochemical characterisation of their oligomerisation state and activity (gel filtration, GTPase activity assay, limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry). -->
- **January -- June 2005**: \
Work in the laboratory of enzymology and structural biochemistry (LEBS, CNRS UPR9063) directed by Henry Grosjean to study the modular structure of three archaeal tRNA methyltransferases. 

I would be happy to send full resume upon request.
