## Short profile
<img style="float: right; margin: 5px;" src="https://jensenlab.org/_pages/people_ufukkirik.jpg" /> I am a multicultural, multilingual, multidisciplinary scientist with multiple areas of interest within bioinformatics.   I usually have my code [well-caffeinated](https://java.com/en/) and [full of snakes](https://www.python.org/), as well as taking a [pirate's approach](https://www.r-project.org/) to statistics.

Besides being prolific in bad puns; I work with analysis of, and method development for, mass-spectrometry proteomics data. On occasion, I take a shot at analysing next-gen sequencing data, as well.

Besides the scientific projects I often participate in extracurricular academic and social projects, such as being a representative for the [students and postdocs association at CPR](http://www.cpr.ku.dk/about/student-and-postdoc-association-spa/) and organising collaborative workshops on developing teamwork and communication skills. I am fairly active on StackExchange sites, particularly Academia and StackOverflow.
