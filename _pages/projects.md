In the JensenLab, we always work on exciting new research projects, many but not all of which relate to developing [resources](/resources/). The projects fall into three broad research topics:

* [Network biology](/projects/networks/)
* [Proteomics](/projects/proteomics/)
* [Text mining](/projects/textmining/)

The projects are often done in collaboration with other research groups within the [NNF Center for Protein Research](http://www.cpr.ku.dk/), nationally, or internationally. If you are interested in doing a student project in the group, feel free to [contact us](mailto:lars.juhl.jensen@cpr.ku.dk).
