We are always looking for Master's students to join the lab to work on a project. All projects are estimated to last between three and six months and basic programming knowledge is required.

## Text mining

### Biomedical text mining: exploring resources beyond PubMed

Project advisors: Alexander Junge and Lars Juhl Jensen)

Projected starting date: as soon as possible

Text mining of the biomedical literature has been successful in retrieving interactions between a broad spectrum of biomedical entities. The Jensen lab is co-developing a range of widely used databases cataloging associations such as STRING for protein–protein interactions, DISEASES for disease–gene associations, and STITCH for chemical–protein interactions. A central component of all resources is the automatic mining of abstracts and open access full texts available in PubMed. For more information about the resources is available [here](/resources/).

Recent work indicates that the incorporation of additional articles yields considerable improvements in the inference of associations from text [1]. Motivated by these findings, the main focus of this project is to explore resources for text mining beyond PubMed and to study the effect of incorporating different additional source on the quality of the identified associations. The quality will be measured by comparing predicted associations to a gold standard of expert-curated associations. Potential sources of text are 7000+ relevant preprints available in bioRxiv, patents available via USPTO, clinical trial records or proposals of funded research grants.

The project is ideal to get started with co-occurrence based text mining approaches, improve your skills on the command line for handling and cleaning large data files as well as to become more proficient in a programming language used for data analysis (such as Python).
