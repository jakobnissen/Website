One of the core activities of the lab is to develop and maintain databases and tools, which are used by thousands of researchers around the world every week. The most famous of these is the [STRING](https://string-db.org/) database, which we run in collaboration with groups at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de/) and the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). Many of our other resources either contribute directly to STRING (e.g. the text-mining tools), complement it with additional information (e.g. subcellular localization, expression, and disease associations), or build upon it.
