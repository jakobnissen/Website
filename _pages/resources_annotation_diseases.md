Identification of disease genes and prioritization of candidate drug targets or biomarkers are important application areas of bioinformatics in general and network analysis in particular. To facilitate such analyses, we have developed the [DISEASES](https://disease.jensenlab.org/) database, which is updated on a weekly basis and integrates disease-gene associations from automatic text mining, manually curated literature, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We further unify the evidence by assigning confidence scores that facilitate comparison of the different types and sources of evidence.

The reanalysis of GWAS is handled the [DistiLD](http://distild.jensenlab.org/) database. In this resource we link published GWAS studies to standardized disease codes, place the associated SNPs in the genomics context of gene annotations and linkage-disequilibrium blocks, and provide a web interface to explore and visualize them.

The continuous work on improving the DISEASES database is done as part of the NIH program [Illuminating the Druggable Genome](https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg), which aims to shed light on unstudied and understudied drug targets. Through this project we also contribute to web resources on drug targets maintained by our US collaborators, including [Pharos](https://pharos.nih.gov/) and [TIN-X](http://www.newdrugtargets.org/).
