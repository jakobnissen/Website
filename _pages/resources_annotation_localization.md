Whereas molecular networks can capture many aspects of protein functions, most current networks do not capture the important dimensions of space and time. We lead the development of several resources that aim to capture this in a way that integrates tightly with STRING and related network resources.

The spatial dimension is captured by two web-accessible databases, [COMPARTMENTS](https://compartments.jensenlab.org/) and [TISSUES](https://tissues.jensenlab.org/), which focus on protein localization at the subcellular and organismal level, respectively. Both resources are updated on a weekly basis and integrate evidence from manually curated literature, high-throughput screens, and automatic text mining. We map all evidence to common protein identifiers and ontology terms and further unify it by assigning confidence scores that facilitate comparison of the different types and sources of evidence. We finally visualize these scores on schematics of eukaryotic cells and mammals to provide a convenient overview.

The temporal aspect is more difficult to capture in a systematic manner, since time is always with respect to a biological process and different processes take place on vastly different time scales. So far we have focused on understanding temporal regulation in the context of the eukaryotic cell division cycle which has been studied several organisms, employing a wide range of high-throughput technologies, such as microarray-based mRNA expression profiling and quantitative proteomics. We have created an online database, [Cyclebase](https://cyclebase.org/), which allows users to easily visualize and download results from genome-wide, cell cycle-related experiments.
