Given the name of the group, Cellular Network Biology, it should come as no surprise that much of our work centers around molecular interactions within and between cells. As part of this, we develop and maintain several databases on the topic.

Together with groups at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de/) and the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) we have created the heavily used [STRING](https://string-db.org/) database, which covers both physical interactions and functional associations between proteins. Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from co-expression analysis, detection of shared selective signals across genomes, automated text-mining of the scientific literature and computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on orthology. The underlying orthology relationships are available through the [eggNOG](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/) database, and the STRING network is expanded with chemical-protein interactions in the [STITCH](https://stitch-db.org/) database.

We have furthermore expanded the STRING network to cover also microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs in the [RAIN](https://rth.dk/resources/rain/) resource, which we develop in collaboration with the [Center for non-Coding RNA in Technology and Health](https://rth.dk/).

Most recently, we have created [STRING Viruses](http://viruses.string-db.org/), which is a sister resource to STRING that extends the scope from intra-species interactions of proteins from cellular organisms to include also viral proteins and their interactions with host proteins.
