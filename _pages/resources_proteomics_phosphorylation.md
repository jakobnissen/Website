Being located next to a world-leading mass spectrometry-based proteomics facility that focuses on post-translational modifications, the group has been involved in the development of several tools for analysis of such data.

The lab jointly developed the kinase-substrate interaction resources [NetworKIN](http://networkin.info/), [NetPhorest](http://netphorest.info/), and [KinomeXplorer](http://kinomexplorer.info/) with the [LindingLab](http://lindinglab.org/) who now maintains them. These resources provide an atlas of the sequence specificities of kinases and kinase families, which is combined with the STRING network to predict the kinases that are most likely to be responsible for the phosphorylation of observed phosphorylation sites. We also developed [DoReMi](http://doremi.jensenlab.org/), which is a generalization of NetworKIN that allows users search with a user-specified sequence motif and prioritize the matches based on their network context.

Building upon this, we developed the [Phomics](http://phomics.jensenlab.org/) toolset, which can perform kinase enrichment analysis based on NetworKIN predictions as well as kinase activation loop analysis and site-based term enrichment analysis.
