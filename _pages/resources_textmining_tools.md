The source code for the tagger software is available at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/larsjuhljensen/tagger/), along with a detailed README describing how to use the tagger. If you prefer to not have to compile it yourself, you can also access it as a Docker container at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/larsjuhljensen/tagger/).
